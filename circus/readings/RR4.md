“…every relationship too, throws a digital shadow.” 
In thinking back on relationships prior to the advent of technologic innovation, especially the era of instant communication that we live in, there was certainly no digital sphere for relationships to live through or within. And even now, most people might not immediately think of relationships as something that can be largely defined or existing in that digital environment. Our digital history, our footprints, now can vividly recount the growth and death of relationships. Around the world people can connect, form friendships, create partnerships and even find love. My grandma, who has largely avoided learning to use any form of technology, finally setup Wi-Fi at her home so she can email me when I am abroad. Every week I facetime my friends and brother from back home, and I message them on the daily through apps like Instagram or Snapchat. I’ve made friends through discord from countries I’ve never visited. And while I think it is amazingly useful to be able to communicate the way we can today, there is certainly a darker side of those connections that can form. At any moment we can see what other people are doing, where they are at, and who they are with depending on the platform. Being “left on read,” feels almost like a rejection to some people. As if the person is right beside us and actively ignored the question that we just said to their face. It’s almost as if we are expected to never leave the conversation now, and will always be active participants.
