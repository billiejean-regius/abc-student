## This is a README.md page

What's nice about files called "README.md" is that GitHub shows them as *front page* of a folder -- for the placeholder project in this case. If you are reading this text in your browser after clicking on `projects>placeholder` in your (forked) repository, you will see what I mean. You see? - above is all the files in the directory (in this case ``website``) and below it will always render the README.md file. We will make use of this throughout the whole semester.

``README.md`` file are written in "Markdown" "language". It's a bliss to work with and easy to learn. For now, just get into the habit of including README.md files in your folders in which you describe what the files are about.

Oh, and Atom has a Markdown Preview option that renders markdown for you as you type. Find it at ``Packages>Markdown Preview>Toggle Preview``
