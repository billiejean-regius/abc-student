"Under construction", a hallmark of the early web that in today's web-society is hardly ever implemented in the same glaringly bright way it was done in the early days of its existence. That's not to say that elements of this design do not persist, however, it is much more minute than before. Rather, web design continues to evolve, thus, it is always under construction in a way. Users are no longer made blatantly aware of this fact, as that knowledge lies behind seamlessly scrolling pages and professional UX design. For me, these web elements mentioned in Lialina are quite nostalgic, and often evoke a greater sense of creativity and understanding of someone than most modern web pages. I think this is due to the highly commercialized and corporate feel of most sites, as we gave up what was a “mockery” of design for ease and simplicity. As Lialina wrote, it now follows “very strict standards and it is “disciplined and formalized.” 
Lialina’s work is to perhaps in a way, follow the evolution of design on the web, remarking upon elements that influenced design and how it still exists in some facet of modern design.
